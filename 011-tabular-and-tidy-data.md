####1.1 Organising tabular data in python
###What is Tabular data?
In a table along the rows are observations, along the columns are features and cell in a table is called value. In structured data all the rows and columns has to have an entry for each block in table. 
###Tabular Data and Python Data Structures
Working with lists:
Python comes with several data structures that we can use to organize tabular data. Let's start by putting a single observation in a list.
   
   ```
   house_0_list = [115910.26, 128, 4]
   house_0_list

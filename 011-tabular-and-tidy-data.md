  What is Tabular data?</br>
In a table along the rows are observations, along the columns are features and cell in a table is called value. In structured data all the rows and columns has to have an entry for each block in table.  
  Tabular Data and Python Data Structures</br> 
  Working with lists:</br>
Python comes with several data structures that we can use to organize tabular data. Let's start by putting a single observation in a list. 
   
```
   house_0_list = [115910.26, 128, 4]
   house_0_list  
```
